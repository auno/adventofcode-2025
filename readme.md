# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for Advent of Code solutions for 2025.

## Usage

After installing `cargo-aoc` and following the [credentials setup instructions](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc#setting-up-the-cli) (or providing your own `input` directory with the appropriate file
naming), you can run any specific day's solution using something like

    cargo aoc --day 1
